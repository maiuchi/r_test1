### Summary 

* Total number of clients served: 221 people
* 44% increase in tickets solved in April, 2020 compared to April, 2019. This suggests that our services are visible, perhaps increasingly so, despite the fact that the pandemic has imposed a strict remote working environment. 
* Potential revisions/ creation of resources:
    + [A Comparison of Reviews](https://library.cumc.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/page/A%20Comparison%20of%20Reviews.pdf) (revise/ promote)
    + Developing search strategies (potential KBA topic)
* Existing KBAs to promote:

### April 2019
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Health Sciences Library staff began working remotely beginning on March 16, 2020 per University and State leadership. The plot below shows the service trend of tickets for the informationist team in April 2019, as this will be used as a  measure of comparison to see how COVID-19 affected the services we provide.

### April 2019 vs. April 2020

Despite the concerns we had that the pandemic may pose an additional challenge in our users  reaching out to us, the data show  an approximate 44% increase in the tickets solved in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Also, the shape of graphs are more or less similar, but magnified in April 2020. This result suggests that the pandemic has had a potentially positive effect on the amount of users seeking our services.  We understand many of our clientele have turned their focus onto seeking guidance for various scholarly projects including those that are COVID-19 related, while other research endeavors have been temporarily put on hold during the pandemic.

### Ticket trends comparison 

The general trend of our top client being VP&S, Mailman, SON, and NYP persists this month. In March 2020, service requests from NYP client declined (2 tickets solved), likely due to a focus on COVID-19 clinical patient care. However, NYP requests for assistance increased once again in April 2020. 

For those who classified themselves as “other," three tickets were from undergrad students and one was from non-CU faculty. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Ticket distribution by day 

This plot contains the data that are zendesk inquiries, direct emails, and appointments (n=64), which excludes the classes conducted in April 2020. As shown on the plot, we had the highest volume of ticket inquires on Fridays in April, 2020. Since the quarantine started, we no longer see the trends of Wendendays being the low-volume day. Instead, Mondays and Tuesdays become the new low volume days. This might suggest some changes in our clients’ way of working/ how their classes being conducted. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#days--------
infoApr20_CLN <- within(infoApr20_CLN, 
                        day <- factor(day,

                                                 "sunday")))
infoApr20_CLN_noClass <- infoApr20_CLN %>% filter(serviceType != 311928)

dayPlot <- ggplot(infoApr20_CLN_noClass, aes(day)) +

```

#### More detailed breakdown of the ticket distribution by day as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dayTable <- table(infoApr20_CLN_noClass$day) %>% as.data.frame() %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
colnames(dayTable) <- c("day", "n")

dayTable$day <- as.character(dayTable$day)
dayTable$day <- toTitleCase(dayTable$day)

formattable(dayTable, 
            align = c("l","l"))
```

### More on day trends

By the first plot, it shows that student population appears to be pulling the high volume trend on Friday. When this is broken down by affiliations, both Mailman and SON have the highest request volume on Thursday; however, VP&S’s request shows a high concentration on Fridays. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

When breaking down the data by day, role, and affiliation, it shows that inquiries from students are high in volume in the latter half of the week (Thursday and Friday).

### Appointment time-frame

The plot below shows the distribution of phone/ Zoom appointments in April, 2020. As shown below, about 97% of appointments were conducted via Zoom, suggesting uninterrupted service as users made the  transition from in-person appointment to Zoom appointment. 

Similar to what we had seen in as March, 2020, our clients show preference in having in-person/ zoom appointments during the morning time frame (~ 11:59 am) or late afternoon time frame (3 pm - 4:59 pm) in April, 2020. 

Compared to March, 2020, the number of appointments conducted increased by 28% in April.

### Tickets solved by venue

Unlike the general trends, Online conference (Zoom meetings) is the most popular venue in April, 2020. This might be because of in-person appointments becoming zoom meetings, in addition to a general increase in the volume of tickets. The data show that about a half of the inquires are appointments, the other half is solved via written form of communication. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

            align = c("l", "r"))
```


### Zendesk service categories

About 41% of service requested are classified as “Literature Search,” and 36% of requests are classified as “Systematic Review” from the Zendesk ticket form. These two are typically top categories as “Literature Search” contains various types of services, and “Systematic Review” has been one of our distinct services that has a high demand. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

### More detailed categories

The recoded data show that our clients seek for assistance in development of search strategies (where people haven’t started the search yet and asked for assistance) the most. This might be a good topic for crafting a KBA or instructional document. Our clients also appear to need some help in selection of databases (people do not know which databases to search in). We already have a resource on how to select a database [(KBA: Which databases should I search? A strategy for selecting appropriate sources)](https://new.library.cumc.columbia.edu/node/2257) which is a great resource to refer to. The trend of these two categories being most popular inquires persists from March, 2020. 

It is noteworthy that compared to March, 2020, inquiries regarding editing search strategies increased. This might suggest that some clients are repeaters or some more advanced clients started to use our services as they turned their focus to other scholarly pursuits that can be done remotely during the pandemic. It would be important to track and analyze the trends on this category, because if inquires shift from the development of search strategies to editing search strategies, this may be an indicator that our clients have enough confidence in the their ability to utilize our resources to start their own search (enabling self-learning) and our support can solidify and improve their search strategy to a higher level.

### Resources 

This month, Pubmed continues to be our most utilized resource. However, higher volumes of Covidence and Prisma suggest a large volume of systematic review inquiries, which is consistent  with the methodology data (below). 

```{r, include=FALSE}
#resources used

res <- gather(infoApr20_CLN3, key = "nice.id", "count", Accessmedicine:Zotero)

res <- res[!(res$count == 0),]

res2 <- table(res$nice.id) %>% as.data.frame() %>% arrange(desc(Freq))

colnames(res2) <- c("resources", "count")

#format the categories (changing how they look)
res2$resources <- gsub("_", " ", res2$resources)
res2$resources <- toTitleCase(res2$resources)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "grey7"), 
        axis.title.y = element_text(color = "grey7"),

        legend.position = "right")

formattable(res2,
            align = c("l", "r"))
```

### Methodology

The trend of Systematic Review being the most popular methodology persists in April, 2020. It is noteworthy that 5 tickets are regarding scoping review, a trend not observed in March, 2020. Also, about 11% of clients are unsure of which review to conduct. This suggests that providing continued guidance on review types and  revamping of  [A Comparison of Reviews](https://library.cumc.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/page/A%20Comparison%20of%20Reviews.pdf) may be helpful.  We also noticed a trend of “neither review nor quant” was a close second to Systematic Review.  This means that about half of our clients seek our services for general literature search strategies.  

```{r, include=FALSE}
#methodologies 
method <- table(infoApr20_CLN3$methodology) %>% as.data.frame() %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
colnames(method) <- c("methodology", "count")

method$methodology <- toTitleCase(method$methodology)

  ggplot(., aes(x = reorder(methodology, - count), count)) +

```

### Project type 

In April 2020, the most popular project type was publication. Considering that most of the clients who submitted inquiries regarding publications in March 2020, were clients from CBCH or SON, it follows that there would be a similar breakdown in April 2020. However, the clients who identified their project type as publications varies from students to staff. Also, thesis and dissertation related inquiries are high volume this month, which makes sense in terms of the upcoming May commencement. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
#project types
project <- table(infoApr20_CLN3$projectType) %>% as.data.frame() %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
colnames(project) <- c("project", "count")

#format the categories (changing how they look)
project$project <- gsub("_", " ", project$project)
project$project <- toTitleCase(project$project)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
project %>% 
  top_n(4) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = reorder(project, - count), count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill= "#000080", alpha = 0.9) +

        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "grey7"), 
        axis.title.y = element_text(color = "grey7"), 
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),

### Online classes 

Five online classes were conducted in April, 2020. 

* Those are: 
    + Self-Editing Workshop (6 attendees)
    + Survival Skills Workshop (5 attendes)
    + Index Flex (3 attendees)
    + VP&S Mechanisms and Practice Seminar (~120 attendees)
    + So You Want to do a Systematic Review Class (1 attendee)
    
Total number clients served from the classes in April is about 135.  They are from various schools and affiliations, which includes but not limited to Mailman, SON, VP&S, and NYP. 

### Other

#### COVID-19

Among 64 tickets, 2 of them are COVID-19 related inquiries, 1 is likely to be COVID-19 related 

#### Forms 

We’ve started to use the new user inquiry form since early March, 2020. The majority of the web request come from the new form. However, unlike in the past, the number of inquiries via CUL form has increased. This might indicate that people are also finding the HSL services from the Morningside campus libraries. This may change  as we complete the transition to the new website and/or after we emerge from the pandemic. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
webReq <- infoApr20_CLN3 %>% filter(venue == "Website Request")

form <- table(webReq$form) %>% as.data.frame() %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
colnames(form) <- c("form", "count")

form$form <- as.character(form$form)
form$form <- toTitleCase(form$form)

formattable(form, 
            align = c("l", "r"))

```

Among the new forms, the majority of the tickets that are assigned to the informationists originated from the consult form, which suggest that this classification may be working and that  the information available from the new inquiry forms is playing an important role in helping the informationists to further unify how we are able to document user interactions. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
form_new <- infoApr20_CLN3 %>% filter(form == "new") 
form_new <- table(form_new$form_type) %>% as.data.frame() %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
colnames(form_new) <- c("form type (new)", "count")

#format the table
form_new$`form type (new)` <- gsub("_", " ", form_new$`form type (new)`)
form_new$`form type (new)` <- toTitleCase(form_new$`form type (new)`)

formattable(form_new, 
            align = c("l", "r"))
```
